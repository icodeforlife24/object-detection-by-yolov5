# **Welcome to Week 1**

# Week 1 — Deep Learning Foundations

This week we’ll build the essential deep-learning foundations needed for the project.

- **If you’re new to deep learning**
  - Start with `Neural Networks`
  - Then move on to `Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)`
  - Finally, learn `OpenCV` for image processing

- **If you’re already familiar**
  - Quickly **review** `Neural Networks`, `CNNs`, and `OpenCV`

- **Hands-on practice**
  - Complete a few tutorials to deepen your understanding

> Stay active and practice regularly to get the most out of this learning journey — keep your energy up and let’s get started!


1. [Neural Networks](./Neural%20networks)

>  This folder contains the resources to gain foundational knowledge on Neural Networks. They have great visual explanations

2. [Convolutional Neural Networks](./CNN)

> This folder contains the resources for Convolutional Neural Networks. There are tutorials at the end to understand how these are implemented in code

3. [OpenCV](./OpenCV)

> This folder contains the resources for OpenCV
